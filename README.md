# reddit-email-bot
bot that emails the user when a new post is made in specified subreddits matching specified keywords

To use, you will need to enter your information on the credentials_template.py file (And rename the file to
credentials.py), then run the bot on your computer.

For my own personal use, the e-mail address I send the
notifications to is the address for my verizon cell phone, meaning these messages appear as text messages.
Will of course work with a regular e-mail account, just food for thought.
