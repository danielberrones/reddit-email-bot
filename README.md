# reddit-email-bot
bot that emails the user when a new post is made in specified subreddits matching specified keywords

To use, you will need to enter your information on the credentials.py file

For my own personal use, the e-mail address I send the notifications to is the address for my verizon cell phone, meaning these messages appear as text messages.
Will of course work with a regular e-mail account, just food for thought.

The reddit_email_bot.py file needs to be supplied keywords to search for, and subreddits to search in, in its current state it will not work, the values in the file are not valid.


When both files have been set up, you simmply need to run the reddit_email_bot.py file on your computer!
